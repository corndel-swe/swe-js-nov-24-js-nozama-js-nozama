Take a look at
[managing the database](https://tech-docs.corndel.com/express/managing-the-database)

In the `db/migrations` folder, you will find the `.sql` files needed to reset
and seed the database.

In `package.json`, you will find the `db:reset` script. This script will run the
`1-reset.sql` file to drop and recreate the tables.

**Todo**

1. Run `npm run test:d1e1`. You should see that the tests are failing.

2. Run `npm run db:reset` to create the tables. Running this script should
   automatically create the database file called `db.sqlite` in the `db` folder,
   if it doesn't exist already.

3. Test again to see that the first two tests are now passing.

4. Create and run a `db:seed` script that will seed the database with the seed
   data using `2-seed.sql`. (Hint: you will need to modify `package.json` to
   create this script - check out the `db:reset` script for inspiration.)

5. Test again to see that all tests are now passing.
