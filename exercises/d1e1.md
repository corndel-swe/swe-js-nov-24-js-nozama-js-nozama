# Day 1 Exercise 1

Our goal in this exercise it to create the database tables and fill them with
some seed data.

Take a look at
[managing the database](https://tech-docs.corndel.com/express/managing-the-database)

In the `db/migrations` folder, you will find the `.sql` files needed to reset
and seed the database.

In `package.json`, you will find the `db:reset` script. This script will run the
`1-reset.sql` file to drop and recreate the tables.

## Todo

- [x] Run `npm run test:d1e1`. You should see that the tests are failing.

- [x] Run `npm run db:reset` to create the tables. Running this script should
      automatically create the database file called `db.sqlite` in the `db`
      folder, if it doesn't exist already.

- [x] Test again to see that the first two tests are now passing.

- [x] Create and run a `db:seed` script that will seed the database with the
      seed data using `2-seed.sql`.

> [!TIP]
>
> You will need to modify `package.json` to create this script - check out the
> `db:reset` script for inspiration.

- [x] Test again to see that all tests are now passing.
