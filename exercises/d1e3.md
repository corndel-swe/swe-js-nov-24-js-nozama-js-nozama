Take a look at
[adding a model layer](https://tech-docs.corndel.com/express/adding-a-model-layer.html).

In `models/User.js` you will find a `User` class. This class contains methods to
interact with the database.

The method `User.findAll` has been implemented already. Note that the `password`
is not included in the returned objects.

**Todo**

1. Run `npm run test:d1e3` to see the failing tests.

2. Implement `User.findById(id)` which returns a single user, found by their ID.
   Test again.
