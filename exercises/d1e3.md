# Day 1 Exercise 3

Our goal in this exercise is to create methods to read and write data in our
database.

Take a look at
[adding a model layer](https://tech-docs.corndel.com/express/adding-a-model-layer.html).

In `models/User.js` you will find a `User` class. This class contains methods to
interact with the database.

The method `User.findAll` has been implemented already. Note that the `password`
is not included in the returned objects.

## Todo

- [ ] Run `npm run test:d1e3` to see the failing tests.

- [ ] Implement `User.findById(id)` which returns a single user, found by their
      ID. Test again.
