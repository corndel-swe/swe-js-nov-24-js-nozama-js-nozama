## Day 2 Exercise 2

Our goal in this exercise is to connect to the database from our javascript
files.

Take a look at
[connecting to a database](https://tech-docs.corndel.com/express/connecting-to-a-database.html).

In `db/index.js` we have imported the dependencies, but we haven't connected to
the database yet.

## Todo

- [ ] Follow the steps shown in the video to connect to the database using
      `knex`. You should connect to the `db.sqlite` database you created in the
      previous exercise.

- [ ] Make sure your default export is a `const` called `db`.

- [ ] Run the tests with `npm run test:d1e2` to ensure they pass.
