Take a look at
[connecting to a database](https://tech-docs.corndel.com/express/connecting-to-a-database.html).

In `db/index.js` we have imported the dependencies, but we haven't connected to
the database yet.

**Todo**

1. Follow the steps shown in the video to connect to the database using `knex`.
   You should connect to the `db.sqlite` database you created in the previous
   exercise.

2. Make sure your default export is a `const` called `db`.

3. Run the tests with `npm run test:d1e3` to ensure they pass.
