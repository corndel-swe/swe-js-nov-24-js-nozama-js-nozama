# Nozama

Welcome to Nozama!

Nozama is a world-class e-commerce platform that allows users to browse and
purchase products from a wide range of categories. Users can also leave reviews
on products they have purchased, and view reviews left by other users.

This repo contains the source code for the Nozama backend, which is built using
Node.js, Express, and Knex. It is an API which allows developers to interact
with the Nozama database, so they can build their own applications on top of it.

> [!CAUTION]

> Please note that this repo is for learning purposes. It contains plenty of bad
> security practices, and should not be used in production.
