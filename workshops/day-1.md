# Day 1

Today's workshop is all about building up the models to add functionality to
Nozama. We are going to add more classes and methods into the `models` directory
so that we are able to query the database for useful results.

Eventually, these models will serve as the backbone of an API, allowing other
developers at Nozama to build websites, mobile apps, and other services that use
the data we have stored in our database.

## Backlog

The backlog for this workshop is available as a
[Trello board](https://trello.com/b/xKHlc7Xy/nozama). This is a public template.

1. One person on your team should create a new board from this template

2. Then add the rest of your team as members.

You can then use this board to track your progress throughout the workshop.

## Workflow

Each item in the backlog has a checklist. You won't be able to complete all the
items on the checklist today, but you should be able to work on the items
pertaining to the model layer.

The recommended workflow is to:

1. Decide as a team which items you will work on, and whether you will pair
   program or not.

2. Assign the items to team members in Trello and, when you're ready to start
   work, move the item to "Doing".

3. Create a new branch for the item.

4. Work through the checklist as far as you can. Move it to "Review" and ask a
   team member to review the code. If the review is accepted, merge the branch.

5. If there are still items on the checklist, move it back to "Backlog".
   Otherwise, move it to "Done".

At any point, if you get stuck, move the item to "Blocked" and do some research,
ask for help, or move on to another item.
